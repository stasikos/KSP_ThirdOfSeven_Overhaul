Spreadsheet with all available experiments, situations and science you can get
- science balance should be done in sane way. I think 90% of coverage is for
  hardcore ones and 50% is for ones who "normal". And it is a lot of science.
then just check how much we need in our techtree with 

Fix FS_Biplane engine crash tolerance (also check rest of the parts)
Adopt kerbalFoundry Jet APU (or make own version of it)
0.625m payload fairing
0.375m payload fairing? :)
Sort 1.25m LFO engines. Really need them for test career mode
Find That mod to help with shrouds on smaller engines when bottom part is much
larger
Write and test patch for Bon Voyage to allow water trips
Allow to use FS droptanks much sooner than almost never :)
S2 Commercial Cockpit should make craft "Airplane", not "Ship"
Still need to sort over9000 parts
egrep -c '^\s+PART$' ../ModuleManager.ConfigCache gives 723 and it looks like
much even without all mods we need
