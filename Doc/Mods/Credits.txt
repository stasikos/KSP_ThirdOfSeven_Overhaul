It is updated quite rarely, so you need to change version file to avoid annoying
notifications about "built for 1.2.0"
FilterExtensions 3.2.0 by Ialdabaoth and maintained by sarbian

You need latest stable firespitter plugin
I use version 7.6.

ModularFlightIntegrator 1.2.4.0 by sarbian
ModuleManager 3.0.4 by Ialdabaoth and maintained by sarbian

That makes early carreer more realistic with unmanned missions

Not a plugin only, but also parts from Firespitter needed
most are pruned using Firespitter.prnl I need biplane and small set of tools
from it. Rest is broken and useless anyway


you can probably use latest version of parts, but I use 7.4.2

Near Future Solar 0.8.8 by Nertea
Small mod to show surfrace speed in more convenient way
Download here:
Feel free to use latest version always
Quite useful mod to make craft design much easier

While it is quite cheaty, without it I can't do place these things around kerbin
and set up scenes.


Addon version checker 
Optional mod to stay up-to-date with mods


Used v3.0.4. Adds better categories filter in VAB/SPH for parts

USITools 0.10.1.0 by RoverDude
KerbalEngineerRedux 1.3.0.1 by cybutek
Tool to remove parts you don't need from Gamedata. Or just hide them in VAB/SPH
lists.
