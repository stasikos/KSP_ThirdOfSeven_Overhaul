Hello, this is me (aka ThirdOfSeven on KSP Forums) and it is my attempt to make another overhaul to career mode KSP.

Currently idea is to make new TechTree like I like to try and to change all parts using ModuleManager patches to fit one game I like.

And this repository is more like backup of mine development. So if you want support, I can't provide any until I make at least "beta" quality.

This package is planned to have some "required" and "optional" mods you need to download and install manually from the respective sources.
