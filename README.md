Hello, this is me (aka ThirdOfSeven on KSP Forums) and it is my attempt to make another overhaul to career mode KSP.

Currently idea is to make new TechTree like I like to try and to change all parts using ModuleManager patches to fit one game I like.

And this repository is more like backup of mine development. So if you want support, I can't provide any until I make at least "beta" quality.

Goal is to create pack to implement all my ideas for next Let's play series, including:
Unmanned-first style space program (my own tree and sounding rockets should help)
Life Support (TAC + Kerbal Health, I want something more complicated than USI LS)
Extended Communication
Planet scanning
Some militarization (if BDArmory is still like before)
Programmable computers (I mean kOS)
Simplier Automation with triggers (like SmartParts)
Piston Aviation, Electric engines, Helicopters, Airships (of course there lots of mods for this)
Marine and Submarine exploration (same as above)
7 sizes/systems and 3 tier system (just for lulz) for everything (Including giant planes like Mriya) (it is what I do with overhauling)
Reusable space programs (FMRS/StageRecovery)
Extended contract system (We have some, maybe they need updates or... okay, I can make some contracts too).
FTL/Future propulsion technologies/Fission and fusion reactors (NF and KSPI)
Beamed power (KSPI)
More science experiments (Thank you DMagic)
ISRU (Stock/KSPI/USI)
Colonization (USI?)
Robotics/Moving parts (Infernal Robotics, of course).
Building things in space and other places.

This package is planned to have some "required" and "optional" mods you need to download and install manually from the respective sources.
Also if you want to really follow my way, you will need to remove tons of parts I can't fit into gameplay using Janitor Closet prunelists. 
Maybe I'll do some scripts to do it, but I can't test them on Windows.
